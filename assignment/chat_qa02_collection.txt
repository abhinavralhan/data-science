[16:14] Shayaan Malik: Sir I just have 1 question regarding the previous assignment
[16:15] Shayaan Malik: We were told to add existing dara source for observational analysis
[16:15] Shayaan Malik: data source*
[16:15] Shayaan Malik: So I added fake data, and I hope its not a mistake
[16:16] Tim Merker: Regarding the current assignment: "The second data set includes data on the salary of people in Germany. The data is accomplished by the
age of each person and whether he or she works in the East or West of Germany." Can we use several plots to represent the data?
[16:16] Shayaan Malik: Sure sir thanks a lot
[16:17] Shayaan Malik: like random data created from scripts as it was shown in the lecture

[16:20] Shayaan Malik: It was hard to find if playing chess could increase the IQ, there is no real data about that on the internet

[16:22] Shayaan Malik: Sure sir
[16:23] Shayaan Malik: Thank you sir
[16:23] Shayaan Malik: Indeed sir I understand now
